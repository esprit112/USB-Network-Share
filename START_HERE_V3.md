## ⚠️ Important Notes

### V2 vs V3 Compatibility

✅ **Can work together:**
- V3 client → V2 server (without new features)
- V2 client → V3 server (without new features)

❌ **Cannot work with TLS:**
- V2 doesn't support encryption
- Only V3↔V3 can use TLS

### Configuration Location Changed

**V2:** Settings not saved (had to re-enter)  
**V3:** Settings saved to:
- Windows: `%APPDATA%\USBNetworkShare\`
- Linux/Mac: `~/.config/usb_network_share/`

**One-time reconfiguration needed when upgrading!**

### New Dependency

**V3 requires:**
- `zeroconf` package for discovery
- Optional but **highly recommended**
- `pip install zeroconf`

Without it:
- Manual IP entry still works
- All other features work
- Just no auto-discovery

---

## 🎯 Common Questions

### "Do I have to upgrade from V2?"

**No, but you should!**

V2 works fine, but V3 gives you:
- ✅ Never re-enter settings
- ✅ Auto-discovery (no IP addresses)
- ✅ Better statistics
- ✅ Priority queue
- ✅ Optional security

### "Will my V2 settings carry over?"

**No** - V2 didn't save settings

But V3 setup is **one time only** - then it remembers forever!

### "Can I keep using V2?"

**Yes!** - V2 files are still there as backup

V3 is completely separate - use whichever you prefer

### "Is V3 more complicated?"

**No!** - It's actually easier:

**V2:** Enter settings every time  
**V3:** Configure once, done forever

### "What if something breaks?"

**You're covered!**
- V2 files still there as backup
- All documented in README_V3.md
- Comprehensive troubleshooting
- Logs for debugging
