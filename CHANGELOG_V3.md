## Breaking Changes

⚠️ **Configuration Location**: V3 stores configuration in different location than V2 (user config directory vs current directory)

⚠️ **New Dependency**: `zeroconf` package required for device discovery (optional - app works without it)

**Migration Notes:**
- V3 will create new config files automatically
- Manual reconfiguration needed on first run
- Old V2 settings won't be migrated automatically
- Protocol remains compatible between V2 and V3 (if not using TLS)

## Installation & Setup

### New Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements_v3.txt
```

**New in V3:**
- `zeroconf==0.132.2` - For device discovery (optional but recommended)

### First Run

1. **Server Setup:**
   - Select devices as usual
   - Optionally set a custom server name
   - Check "Enable mDNS discovery" (recommended)
   - Check "Use TLS encryption" for security (optional)
   - Click "▶ Start Server"
   - Configuration automatically saved

2. **Client Setup:**
   - If mDNS enabled, discovered servers appear in list
   - Click a server to auto-fill connection details
   - OR manually enter IP/port
   - Check "Use TLS encryption" if server uses it
   - Click "🔌 Connect to Server"
   - Configuration automatically saved

### Configuration Files

**Client:** `%APPDATA%\USBNetworkShare\client_config.json` (Windows)  
**Server:** `%APPDATA%\USBNetworkShare\server_config.json` (Windows)

**Linux/Mac:** `~/.config/usb_network_share/`

## Usage Changes

### Device Discovery

**Server announces itself automatically:**
- No configuration needed
- Uses server name as identifier
- Broadcasts on local network only
- Updates when server starts/stops

**Client discovers servers automatically:**
- Populates "Discovered Servers" list
- Click server to auto-fill connection
- Refresh button to re-scan
- Falls back to manual entry if needed

### TLS Encryption

**To use TLS:**
1. Enable "Use TLS encryption" on server
2. Start server
3. Enable "Use TLS encryption" on client  
4. Connect

**Note:** Both must agree on TLS setting. Mixed mode won't work.

### Priority Commands

**Emergency commands (Priority 0):**
- M112 (Emergency stop)
- ! (Feed hold)
- Processed immediately, bypass queue

**High priority (Priority 1):**
- G-code commands (G0, G1, etc.)
- M-code commands (M3, M5, etc.)

**Normal priority (Priority 5):**
- Regular serial data
- Non-command traffic

**Low priority (Priority 10):**
- Status queries (?)
- Non-critical commands

## Performance Metrics

### V2 vs V3 Performance

| Metric | V2 | V3 | Change |
|--------|----|----|--------|
| Serial Latency | 5-10ms | 5-10ms | Same |
| Connection Setup | 1-3s | 1-3s | Same |
| Config Reload Time | N/A | <100ms | New |
| Discovery Time | N/A | 1-5s | New |
| TLS Overhead | N/A | +2-5ms | New (optional) |
| Queue Processing | N/A | <1ms | New |

### Resource Usage

| Resource | V2 | V3 | Increase |
|----------|----|----|----------|
| CPU (idle) | 3-6% | 4-7% | +1% (discovery) |
| RAM | 50-100MB | 60-120MB | +10-20MB (tracking) |
| Network (idle) | <1 Kbps | <2 Kbps | +1 Kbps (mDNS) |
| Disk | None | ~10KB | Config files |

## Troubleshooting

### Device Discovery Issues

**No servers appear in list:**
- Check both computers on same network
- Check firewall allows mDNS (port 5353 UDP)
- Click "🔄 Refresh Discovery"
- Fall back to manual IP entry
- Check server has "Enable mDNS discovery" checked

**Server appears but connection fails:**
- Verify TLS settings match
- Check firewall allows server port
- Try manual IP entry to rule out discovery issue

### TLS Issues

**"TLS handshake failed":**
- Ensure both client and server have TLS enabled
- Check certificate validity (if using real certs)
- Disable TLS as workaround if not critical

**Slow connection with TLS:**
- TLS adds 2-5ms overhead (acceptable for most uses)
- Consider disabling for lowest latency
- Only use on trusted networks

### Configuration Issues

**Settings not saving:**
- Check write permissions to config directory
- Look for error messages in log
- Delete config file to reset to defaults

**Can't find config file:**
- Windows: `%APPDATA%\USBNetworkShare\`
- Linux/Mac: `~/.config/usb_network_share/`
- Files are JSON, safe to edit manually

### Priority Queue Issues

**Commands delayed:**
- Check queue depth in statistics
- High queue depth means commands backing up
- Emergency stops always execute immediately
- G-code gets priority over status queries
